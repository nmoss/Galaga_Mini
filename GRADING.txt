Definition of Game Objects:

	Player's fighter, missiles, enemy galagans

Animation of Game Objects:
	
	Player's fighter moves from side to side. Missiles travel vertically up and down the screen depending on which side fired them. Galagans flap their wings, and the 
	space background scrolls. If the fighter or a galagan is hit, an explosion is drawn to the screen.

Interaction:
	
	If the fighter's missile hits a galagan, they exploded and the player earns 2 points. If the player's fighter is hit by a galagan missile, the player's fighter explodes, and the
	game ends. 

Score:
	The player has a starting score of 0, and 2 points are added whenever a galagan is shot down by the player's missile.
